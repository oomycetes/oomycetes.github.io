#### Jamie McGowan and David Fitzpatrick, 2017

This site contains supplementary material for "[Genomic, Network, and Phylogenetic Analysis of the Oomycete Effector Arsenal](http://msphere.asm.org/content/2/6/e00408-17)", including protein sequences and scripts used in our analysis. It also includes source code for the associated website for viewing the [interative sequence similarity networks](https://oomycetes.github.io/).

Protein sequences and the pipeline to identify potential RxLRs are found in the `SupplementaryMaterial` directory.

Interactive versions of the network are available [here](https://oomycetes.github.io/).
