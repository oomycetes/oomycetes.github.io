- The Downloaded directory contains 23 oomycete proteomes that were publically available.
- The Generated directory contains the predicted proteomes of 14 oomycete species that were generated using Augustus and the corresponding GFF files.
- `species_codes.tsv` contains the full species names and their shortened codes.
- Protein IDs for downloaded proteomes were shortened and editied to make processing easier. The full IDs can be mapped back using the file `original_id_key.tsv`
