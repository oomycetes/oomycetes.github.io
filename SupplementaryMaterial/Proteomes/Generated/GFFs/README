GFF files for the predicted proteomes of 14 oomycete species that were generated using Augustus (or using GeneMark for Pilasporangium apinafurcum).

Gene numbers correspond to the gene IDs in FASTA files. For example for Phytophthora agathidicida (PHAG), augustus gene prediction "g1" in the GFF file corresponds to "PHAG|00001" in the FASTA file.
